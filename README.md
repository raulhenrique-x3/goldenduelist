Page of a personal project created using HTML5, styled by CSS3 and with Javascript functions to provide dynamic and easy access.
The page was created with an intuitive design using colors that match the idea of ​​the site and that are generally well accepted by users.
In the future I will increase more Js functions in the project and also a function to leave the page in night mode.
Responsiveness will be added in the future and records will be made by README.md
